   <p>Grapes are a fruit found in countries throughout the world. 
    Some are best for eating, while others get processed into wine or juice. Most grapes are sweet, but there are varieties that have a thick, tannic skin protecting the sugary flesh, which can change how the grape is used. All grapes grow on vining plants and botanically speaking, grapes are berries. Different varieties of grapes thrive in different locations depending on the climate, soil, water and sunlight.</p>
