<p> The strawberry (Fragaria ananassa) originated in Europe in the 18th century.
    It is a hybrid of two wild strawberry species from North America and Chile.
    Strawberries are bright red, juicy, and sweet.
    Theyâ€™re an excellent source of vitamin C and manganese and also contain decent amounts of folate (vitamin B9) and potassium.
    Strawberries are very rich in antioxidants and plant compounds, which may have benefits for heart health and blood sugar control (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source).
    Usually consumed raw and fresh, these berries can also be used in a variety of jams, jellies, and desserts.</p>
